About the Project
This program demonstrates the use of five IR (Infrared) sensors connected to an Arduino Uno to detect objects. The IR sensors are arranged in series to monitor a specific area or path. The system identifies the presence of objects when they interrupt the IR sensor signals, enabling precise detection in a defined range.

Key Features
Multiple Sensors: Utilizes five IR sensors to increase detection accuracy.
Arduino Uno: A cost-effective microcontroller board used to interface with the sensors and process signals.
Object Detection: The system identifies objects by sensing interruptions in the IR signal.
Scalable Design: The program can be modified to include more sensors or adapt to different use cases.
Applications
Automation: Detecting objects on conveyor belts.
Robotics: Obstacle detection for autonomous navigation.
Security Systems: Monitoring entry or exit in restricted areas.
Traffic Systems: Vehicle detection at intersections.
How It Works
Sensor Placement:
The IR sensors are placed in a series configuration to cover a larger detection area. Each sensor emits infrared light and detects reflected signals.

Arduino Integration:

Each sensor's output is connected to the Arduino Uno.
The Arduino processes signals from the sensors to determine object presence.
Object Detection:

When an object interrupts the infrared signal of any sensor, the Arduino detects the change and triggers a response.
Output:
The system outputs a signal (e.g., LED lighting up or a message displayed on a serial monitor) when an object is detected.
